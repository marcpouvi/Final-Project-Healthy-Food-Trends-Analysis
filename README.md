## Project Description
The intention of this project, is analyzing the trend of healthy food over the last decade in western countries. During the last few years a movement towards a healthier lifestyle is palpable in western society. Basically, this movement is based on two fundamental pillars: 1. Exercising regularly and 2. Eating healthy. Media and social networks, such as instagram or facebook, increasingly offer this type of content. Additionally, new market leading companies are flourishing, offering healthy products to its consumers. 
Being aware of all this, it is normal to think that there is a clear positive trend and that is why people are increasingly interested in consuming this products. Well, in this project the aim is to analyze if this trend its actually real or not.

## Hypothesis
* There has been an increase in publications of healthy recipes 
* There have been more searches for keywords linked to healthy eating 
* Between the years of 2008  and 2018 the number of mentions of tofu increased significantly in the US

## Dataset
I used two different data sources:
* To gather the data related to recipes, I used a kaggle dataset from the web Food.com, one of the largest cooking recipe websites (See link in links section)
* The data related to Google trends, was obtained through pytrends, an unnofficial API for Google Trends. Allows simple interface for automating downloading of reports from Google Trends. 

## Cleaning
Regarding the cleaning of the data, the stock data was already cleaned and ready to be used.
